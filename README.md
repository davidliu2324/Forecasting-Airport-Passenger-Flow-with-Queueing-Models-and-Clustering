# Abstract
This project develops a data-driven approach to forecasting passenger arrival rates at airport security checkpoints and optimizing service counter allocation. Using scheduled flight data, a regression model was built to estimate hourly passenger arrival rates under a Poisson process assumption, validated through Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov testing. Predicted arrival rates were grouped into clusters representing distinct demand profiles, which informed staffing strategies through an M/M/c queueing framework. This method was proposed as an alternative to the traditional approach of using past yearly data to shape demand clusters for server allocation, offering greater adaptability by relying on forecasted demand rather than historical patterns alone. The analysis showed strong alignment between predicted and observed service counters, confirming that staffing levels scale proportionally with demand. Quality-of-service metrics revealed that meeting the target of processing at least 85 percent of passengers within 15 minutes becomes more challenging at higher demand levels but can be maintained with dynamic server adjustments. The model demonstrates practical applicability for real-time operational planning, providing a more responsive and robust alternative to purely historical demand clustering.
